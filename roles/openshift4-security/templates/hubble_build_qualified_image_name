 # Expands to the full name of a home-built container image.
 #
 # This template is meant to be called from Jinja code to define Ansible variables or
 # YAML fields; it is *not* meant to be rendered into a file. Hence its name without
 # an extension.
 #
 # âš  Despite our best efforts, Jinja insists on taking up the file's final newline.
 # Caller beware; use `| trim`.
 #
 # Expected variables:
 #
 #    _image_name    The name of the image i.e. the part that comes after the last slash
 #    _image_tag     (optional) The tag part that comes after the colon
 #
 #}{{ quay_hostname }}/{{ hubble_quay_organization_name }}/{{ _image_name
}}{% if _image_tag is defined %}:{{ _image_tag }}{% endif -%}
