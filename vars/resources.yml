# In this file (and only this file), decisions are made on how to
# allocate the various resources that the OpenShift clusters and their
# associated moving parts (i.e. bastion VMs) will consume.
#
# Resources currently include:
#
# - VMware objects, such as dcs, folders, compute resource pools,
#   datastores and networks
#
# - IPv4 ranges, both “EPFL-public” (in the 10.*.*.* range) and
#   private (e.g. for Kubernetes pods and services).
