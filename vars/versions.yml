# The version of OpenShift to install on spokes.
# âš  The RHACM operator will auto-download patchlevel releases *only*
# (i.e. those that differ by the last digit.) If you want to bump the
# minor version (e.g. from 4.14 to 4.15), then after editing
# `spoke_clusterimageset_version` below, you need to run
#
#     xaasible -t openshift.hub

# ðŸ’¡ Re: 4.14.5 and Camptocamp, see https://jira.camptocamp.com/servicedesk/customer/portal/5/INF-11778
